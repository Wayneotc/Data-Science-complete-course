   # Introduction to Functions
   
   Functions are a fundamental concept in programming, allowing us to encapsulate reusable pieces of code and organize our programs into manageable units. In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by a function name, parentheses `( )`, and a colon `:`. Let's delve deeper into this topic:
   
   ## Definition and Purpose of Functions:
   
   - **Definition:** A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. It takes input arguments, performs operations, and optionally returns a result.
   - **Purpose:** Functions promote code reusability, modularity, and readability. They enable us to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.
   
   ### Syntax of Function Definition:
   
   - A function definition consists of several components:
     ```python
     def function_name(parameters):
         """Optional docstring"""
         # Function body (statements)
         return value  # Optional return statement
     ```
   - **Function Name:** Descriptive name that reflects the function's purpose (follows naming conventions).
   - **Parameters:** Input values passed to the function (optional).
   - **Docstring:** Optional documentation string that describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
   - **Function Body:** Block of statements that define the function's behavior.
   - **Return Statement:** Optional statement to return a value from the function.
   
   ### Creating Simple Functions:
   
   - Let's create a simple function to add two numbers:
     ```python
     def add_numbers(x, y):
         """Add two numbers and return the result."""
         return x + y
     ```
   - Here, `add_numbers` is the function name, and `x` and `y` are parameters representing the numbers to be added.
   
   ### Calling Functions:
   
   - Once a function is defined, we can call it by using its name followed by parentheses and passing the required arguments:
     ```python
     result = add_numbers(5, 3)
     print("Result:", result)  # Output: Result: 8
     ```
   - The function call `add_numbers(5, 3)` returns the sum of `5` and `3`, which is stored in the variable `result`.
   
   ### Parameter vs Argument:
   
   The terms "**parameter**" and "**argument**" are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings in the context of functions:
   
   **Parameter:**
   
   - A parameter is a variable in a function definition.
   - It acts as a placeholder for the actual value (argument) that will be supplied when the function is called.
   - Parameters are specified in the function definition within parentheses `( )`.
   - They serve as the input variables that the function expects to receive when it is invoked.
   
   **Argument:**
   - An argument is the actual value passed to a function when it is called.
   - It corresponds to the parameter defined in the function signature.
   - Arguments are provided in the function call, typically enclosed within parentheses `( )` and separated by commas.
   - They represent the data that the function will operate on or process.
   
   **Example**:
   Consider the following function definition:
   
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       """Greet the user by name."""
       print("Hello,", name)
   ```
   
   In this example:
   - `name` is a parameter of the `greet` function.
   - When the function is called, such as `greet("Alice")`, `"Alice"` is the argument passed to the `name` parameter.
   - In this call, `"Alice"` is the actual value (argument) supplied to the `name` parameter in the function definition.
   
   **Summary:**
   - Parameters are variables declared in the function definition.
   - Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.
   - Parameters define the structure and requirements of the function.
   - Arguments supply the data or values that the function operates on or processes.
   
   ### Different Types of Function Parameters
   
   In Python, functions can have different types of parameters, each serving a specific purpose and providing flexibility in how functions are called and used. Understanding these types of parameters is essential for writing versatile and expressive functions.
   
   
   
   1. #### Positional Parameters:
   
      - Positional parameters are the most basic type of parameters in Python functions.
      - They are defined in the function signature by their position, meaning the order in which they appear matters.
      - When calling a function, arguments are matched to parameters based on their position.
      - Example:
        ```python
        def greet(name, age):
            print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
        
        greet("Alice", 30)  # "Alice" matches with name, and 30 matches with age
        ```
   
      
   
   2. #### Keyword Parameters:
   
      - Keyword parameters allow you to specify arguments by their parameter names when calling a function.
      - They are useful when you want to specify only some arguments and leave others with their default values.
      - Example:
        ```python
        def greet(name, age):
            print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
        
        greet(age=30, name="Alice")  # Using keyword arguments for clarity
        ```
   
      
   
   3. #### Default Parameters:
   
      - Default parameters have a predefined default value in the function signature.
      - If an argument is not provided for a default parameter during function call, the default value is used.
      - They are helpful when you want to make certain parameters optional.
      - Example:
        ```python
        def greet(name, age=18):  # age has a default value of 18
            print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
        
        greet("Alice")  # Only providing name argument, age defaults to 18
        greet("Bob", 25)  # Providing both name and age arguments
        ```
   
      
   
   4. ### Combining Parameter Types:
   
      - Parameters can be combined to take advantage of their respective features.
      - For example, you can have a mix of positional and keyword parameters, with some having default values.
      - Example:
        ```python
        def greet(name, age=18, greeting="Hello"):
            print(f"{greeting}, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
        
        greet("Alice")  # Using default age and greeting
        greet("Bob", greeting="Hi")  # Specifying only the greeting
        greet(age=30, name="Charlie", greeting="Hey")  # Using all keyword arguments
        ```
   
   
   
   #### Example: Arithmetic Operations Function
   
   In this example, we've enhanced the "Arithmetic Operations Function" to demonstrate the flexibility of function parameters in Python. The function accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `operation`. While `x` remains a positional parameter, `y` and `operation` showcase different parameter types. `y` is now a keyword parameter with a default value of `1`, making it optional, while `operation` is a keyword parameter specifying the arithmetic operation to perform, with a default value of `'addition'`. Inside the function, based on the specified operation, the appropriate arithmetic operation is executed. Calling the function with various combinations of positional and keyword arguments showcases the versatility of Python's function parameter handling.
   
   ```python
   def arithmetic_operations(x, y=1, operation="addition"):
       """Perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
   
       Parameters:
           x (int/float): The first number.
           y (int/float, optional): The second number. Defaults to 1.
           operation (str, optional): The arithmetic operation to perform.
                                      Options: 'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication', 'division'.
                                      Defaults to 'addition'.
       
       Returns:
           int/float: The result of the specified arithmetic operation.
       """
       if operation == "addition":
           return x + y
       elif operation == "subtraction":
           return x - y
       elif operation == "multiplication":
           return x * y
       elif operation == "division":
           if y != 0:
               return x / y
           else:
               return "Division by zero error"
       else:
           return "Invalid operation"
   
   
   # Test different function calls
   print("Result of Arithmetic Operations:")
   print("Addition (Positional):", arithmetic_operations(10, 5))  # Positional parameters
   print("Subtraction (Keyword):", arithmetic_operations(y=5, x=10, operation="subtraction"))  # Keyword parameters
   print("Multiplication (Default):", arithmetic_operations(10))  # Default parameter for y
   ```
   
   **Explanation:**
   - The `arithmetic_operations` function now accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `operation`.
   - `x` and `y` are positional parameters, while `operation` is a keyword parameter.
   - The `y` parameter has a default value of `1`, making it optional.
   - The `operation` parameter specifies the arithmetic operation to perform and has a default value of `'addition'`.
   - Inside the function, based on the value of `operation`, the appropriate arithmetic operation is performed.
   - We demonstrate calling the function with different combinations of positional and keyword arguments, showcasing the flexibility of function parameters in Python.
   
   **Sample Function Calls and Outputs:**
   
   - Calling the function with `x=10` and `y=5` (default operation is addition):
   
     ```python
     print(arithmetic_operations(10, 5))  # Output: Addition (Positional): 15
     ```
   
   - Calling the function with `x=10`, `y=5`, and specifying subtraction operation:
   
     ```python
     print(arithmetic_operations(x=10, y=5, operation="subtraction"))  # Output: Subtraction (Keyword): 5
     ```
   
   - Calling the function with only `x=10` (default value for `y=1` and operation is addition):
   
     ```python
     print(arithmetic_operations(10))  # Output: Multiplication (Default): 10
     ```
   
   
   
   ### Argument Passing Mechanisms in Python: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference
   
   Understanding how arguments are passed to functions is crucial for effective programming, as it influences how data is manipulated within functions. In Python, the concept of "pass by value" and "pass by reference" may seem straightforward, but Python's underlying behavior is more nuanced.
   
   1. **Pass by Value:**
      - In pass by value, a copy of the actual value is passed to the function.
      - Any modifications made to the parameter within the function do not affect the original value.
      - This mechanism is typically associated with immutable data types like integers, floats, strings, and tuples in Python.
      - Example:
        ```python
        def modify_value(x):
            x += 10
        
        value = 5
        modify_value(value)
        print(value)  # Output: 5 (unchanged)
        ```
   
   2. **Pass by Reference (or Object Reference):**
      - In pass by reference, a reference to the original object is passed to the function.
      - Modifications made to the parameter within the function affect the original object.
      - This mechanism is associated with mutable data types like lists, dictionaries, and custom objects in Python.
      - Example:
        ```python
        def modify_list(lst):
            lst.append(4)
        
        my_list = [1, 2, 3]
        modify_list(my_list)
        print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (modified)
        ```
   
   3. **Python's Behavior:**
      - Python uses a hybrid approach that resembles pass by value for immutable objects and pass by reference for mutable objects.
      - Immutable objects (e.g., integers, strings) are passed by value, while mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries) are passed by reference.
      - Understanding this behavior helps avoid confusion and unexpected results when working with functions in Python.
   
   
   - In Python, argument passing mechanisms exhibit a combination of pass by value and pass by reference behaviors.
   - Immutable objects are passed by value, while mutable objects are passed by reference.
   - Recognizing these behaviors enables developers to write more efficient and predictable code when working with functions and data manipulation in Python.
   
   
   
   #### Example: Understanding Argument Passing Mechanisms 
   
   In this example, we'll explore how argument passing mechanisms work in Python, focusing on the distinction between pass by value and pass by reference. We'll demonstrate how modifications to function parameters affect the original values and objects.
   
   ```python
   def modify_value(x):
       """Function to modify an integer value."""
       x += 10
       print("Inside function:", x)
   
   value = 5
   print("Before function call:", value)
   modify_value(value)
   print("After function call:", value)
   ```
   
   **Description:**
   - We define a function `modify_value` that takes a single parameter `x`.
   - Inside the function, we increment the value of `x` by 10.
   - We initialize a variable `value` with the integer value `5`.
   - Before calling the function, we print the value of `value`.
   - We call the `modify_value` function with `value` as the argument.
   - After the function call, we print the value of `value` again to observe any changes.
   
   **Output:**
   ```
   Before function call: 5
   Inside function: 15
   After function call: 5
   ```
   
   **Explanation:**
   - Before the function call, the value of `value` is `5`.
   - Inside the function, the parameter `x` is modified to `15`.
   - However, after the function call, the value of `value` remains unchanged at `5`.
   - This behavior demonstrates pass by value, where modifications to the function parameter (`x`) do not affect the original value (`value`).
   
   This example illustrates the pass by value behavior in Python, where modifications to function parameters do not propagate to the original values outside the function. It highlights the distinction between immutable objects (like integers) passed by value and mutable objects (like lists) passed by reference.
   
   
   
   ### Function Documentation (Docstring):
   
   In Python, a docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. It is used to provide documentation for the associated object and serves as a concise description of its purpose, usage, parameters, return values, and any other relevant information. Docstrings provide a way to document functions, making it easier for users to understand their purpose and usage. Good documentation includes a brief description of the function's purpose, explanation of parameters, and description of return values.
   
   
   
   **Example:**
   
   ```python
   def add_numbers(x, y):
       """Add two numbers and return the result.
   
       Parameters:
           x (int): First number.
           y (int): Second number.
   
       Returns:
           int: Sum of x and y.
       """
       return x + y
   ```
   
   #### Purpose of Docstrings:
   
   - Docstrings serve as inline documentation, providing valuable insights into the purpose and usage of functions, classes, and modules.
   - They help other developers (including your future self) understand how to use and interact with the code without needing to delve into the implementation details.
   - Docstrings facilitate automated documentation generation tools like Sphinx, which can generate HTML, PDF, or other formats of documentation from source code.
   
   #### Syntax of Docstrings:
   
   - Docstrings are enclosed within triple quotes (`""" """`) and placed immediately after the function, class, or module definition.
   - They can span multiple lines and follow specific formatting conventions for clarity and consistency.
   
   **Example of Docstring in a Function:**
   
   ```python
   def add_numbers(x, y):
       """Add two numbers and return the result.
   
       Parameters:
           x (int): The first number.
           y (int): The second number.
   
       Returns:
           int: The sum of x and y.
       """
       return x + y
   ```
   
   #### Components of a Docstring:
   
   1. **Description:** A brief summary of the function's purpose and behavior.
   2. **Parameters:** Description of each parameter, including its name, type, and purpose.
   3. **Returns:** Description of the return value(s), including its type and any additional information.
   4. **Examples:** Optional section containing usage examples or additional notes.
   
   #### Recommendation for Writing Docstrings:
   
   1. **Be Descriptive:** Clearly describe the purpose, inputs, and outputs of the function.
   2. **Follow Conventions:** Adhere to established conventions for formatting and structuring docstrings (e.g., Google-style, NumPy-style).
   3. **Use Sphinx-Compatible Markup:** Use reStructuredText or Markdown markup for enhanced readability and compatibility with documentation generation tools.
   4. **Update Docstrings:** Keep docstrings up to date with any changes to the function's behavior or signature.
   5. **Include Examples:** Provide usage examples or illustrative code snippets to demonstrate how to use the function effectively.
   
   ### Function Return Values:
   
   - Functions can optionally return a value using the `return` statement.
   - If no return value is specified, the function returns `None` by default.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def greet(name):
         """Greet the user by name."""
         return f"Hello, {name}!"
     
     message = greet("Alice")
     print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
     ```
   



## Understanding Scope of Variables in Python

Scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables in different parts of a program. It determines where in the code a particular variable can be referenced or modified. Python follows a hierarchical system of variable scoping, which influences how variables are accessed and manipulated within functions, loops, and other code blocks.

1. **Global Scope:**
   - Variables declared outside of any function or loop have global scope.
   - They can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including inside functions and loops.
   - Example:
     ```python
     global_var = 10
     
     def my_function():
         print("Global variable inside function:", global_var)
     
     print("Global variable outside function:", global_var)
     ```

2. **Local Scope:**
   - Variables declared inside a function have local scope.
   - They are accessible only within the function where they are defined.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def my_function():
         local_var = 20
         print("Local variable inside function:", local_var)
     
     my_function()
     ```

3. **Enclosing (Nonlocal) Scope:**
   - Variables declared in an enclosing function (outer function) have enclosing scope.
   - They are accessible to inner functions (nested functions) but not to the outermost scope.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def outer_function():
         outer_var = 30
     
         def inner_function():
             print("Enclosing variable inside inner function:", outer_var)
     
         inner_function()
     
     outer_function()
     ```

4. **Built-in Scope:**
   - Python provides a built-in scope containing pre-defined names like `print()`, `len()`, etc.
   - These names are accessible from anywhere in the program without the need for import statements.
   - Example:
     ```python
     print("Hello, world!")
     ```

**Understanding Scope Hierarchy:**
- Python follows the LEGB rule to resolve variable names in different scopes: Local, Enclosing (nonlocal), Global, and Built-in.
- When a variable is referenced, Python searches for it in the current scope, then in the enclosing scopes, followed by the global and built-in scopes.

Understanding variable scope is essential for writing maintainable and bug-free code in Python. By grasping the concepts of global, local, and enclosing scopes, developers can effectively manage variable visibility and prevent unintended side effects. Mastery of scope helps ensure code clarity, modularity, and scalability in Python programs.

### LEGB (Local, Enclosing (nonlocal), Global, and Built-in)

LEGB is an acronym that represents the order in which Python searches for variable names in different scopes when they are referenced. It stands for Local, Enclosing (or nonlocal), Global, and Built-in scopes. This search order is crucial for understanding how Python resolves variable names and accessing the correct value during program execution.

1. **Local (L) Scope:**
   - The local scope refers to variables defined within the current function.
   - When a variable is referenced inside a function, Python first searches for it in the local scope.
   - If the variable is found in the local scope, its value is used.

2. **Enclosing (or nonlocal) (E) Scope:**
   - The enclosing scope applies to variables defined in the outer (enclosing) function when there is nested function definition.
   - If the variable is not found in the local scope, Python searches in the enclosing scope.
   - This scope is relevant for nested functions where inner functions can access variables from the outer function.

3. **Global (G) Scope:**
   - The global scope includes variables defined at the top level of the module or script.
   - If the variable is not found in the local or enclosing scope, Python searches in the global scope.
   - Variables defined outside of any function or class belong to the global scope.

4. **Built-in (B) Scope:**
   - The built-in scope contains pre-defined names provided by Python.
   - These names include built-in functions and exceptions like `print()`, `len()`, `ValueError`, etc.
   - If the variable is not found in the local, enclosing, or global scope, Python searches in the built-in scope.

**LEGB Search Order:**
- When a variable is referenced, Python follows the LEGB order to search for its value: Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in.
- If the variable is found in any of the scopes, Python stops searching and uses the value from that scope.
- If the variable is not found in any scope, Python raises a `NameError` indicating that the variable is not defined.

**Example**

```python
# Global variable
global_var = 100

def outer_function():
    # Enclosing (nonlocal) variable
    enclosing_var = 200

    def inner_function():
        # Local variable
        local_var = 300
        print("Inside inner function:")
        print("Local variable:", local_var)
        print("Enclosing variable:", enclosing_var)
        print("Global variable:", global_var)

    print("Inside outer function:")
    print("Enclosing variable:", enclosing_var)
    print("Global variable:", global_var)
    inner_function()

print("Outside any function:")
print("Global variable:", global_var)
outer_function()
```

**Output:**
```tex
Outside any function:
Global variable: 100
Inside outer function:
Enclosing variable: 200
Global variable: 100
Inside inner function:
Local variable: 300
Enclosing variable: 200
Global variable: 100
```

**Explanation:**
- At the outermost level (outside any function), we print the value of the global variable `global_var`, which is `100`.
- Inside the `outer_function`, we have an enclosing (nonlocal) variable `enclosing_var` with a value of `200`, and we again print the value of `global_var`.
- Within the `inner_function`, we have a local variable `local_var` with a value of `300`, and we print the values of `local_var`, `enclosing_var`, and `global_var`.
- When calling the `outer_function`, we see how Python searches for variable values in the LEGB order:
  - It first looks for `enclosing_var` in the enclosing scope of `outer_function`.
  - If not found, it then searches for `global_var` in the global scope.
  - Lastly, it looks for `local_var` within the local scope of `inner_function`.
- The output demonstrates how Python resolves variable names based on the LEGB rule, accessing variables from different scopes accordingly.
