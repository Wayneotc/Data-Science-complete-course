## 1- Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)

### Objective:

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with basic Object-Oriented Analysis concepts using Class diagrams. Focus on clarity and completeness in identifying objects, defining their attributes, and visualizing relationships. This foundational understanding will pave the way for more complex software design exercises in the future.

### Description:

Imagine you are tasked with designing a simple system for managing a library. Your goal is to perform Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) to identify the main objects and their relationships in the system.

### Tasks:

1. **Identify Objects:**
   
   - List down the main objects/entities that would be present in a library management system.
   - **UML Diagram:** Class diagram to represent the objects and their attributes.

2. **Define Object Attributes:**
   
   - For each object identified, define at least three attributes.
   - For example, a 'Book' object might have attributes such as title, author, and ISBN.
   - **UML Diagram:** Class diagram (attributes section) to show the attributes of each class.

3. **Model Object Relationships:**
   
   - Draw a simple diagram showing the relationships between the identified objects.
   - **UML Diagram:** Class diagram (relationships) to illustrate the associations between classes.

4. **Describe Object Behaviors:**
   
   - Identify at least one behavior (method) for each object.
   - For example, a 'Book' object might have a method like 'checkAvailability()' to check if it's available for borrowing.
   - **UML Diagram:** Class diagram (methods section) to depict the methods of each class.

5. **Submit Documentation:**
   
   - Write a short document (1-2 pages) summarizing your OOA findings.
   - Include your list of objects, their attributes, relationships, and behaviors.
   - Optionally, you can provide a brief explanation of how these objects would interact in the context of a library management system.

**Submission Guidelines:**

- Submit your assignment as a PDF document.
- Ensure your diagrams are clear and labeled appropriately.
- Use concise language to describe your OOA findings.
