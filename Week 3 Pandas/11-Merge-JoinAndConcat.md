# Merging, Joining and Concatenating

In Pandas, merging, joining, and concatenating are fundamental operations for integrating data from various sources. They allow you to create a single DataFrame that combines information from multiple DataFrames.

## Key Methods:

- **`merge()`:** This is the most versatile method, offering SQL-style join operations. You can specify columns or indexes for joining, define join types, and handle missing values.
- **`.join()`:** This method is simpler, designed for merging DataFrames along a single column (similar to a left join by default).
- **`concat()`:** This method excels at stacking DataFrames vertically (row-wise), useful when you want to combine DataFrames that share the same columns but have no common key for joining.

## Common Join Types:

- **Inner Join (default):** Keeps only rows with matching values in both DataFrames.
- **Left Join:** Keeps all rows from the "left" DataFrame and matching rows from the "right" DataFrame.
- **Right Join:** Keeps all rows from the "right" DataFrame and matching rows from the "left" DataFrame.
- **Outer Join:** Keeps all rows from both DataFrames, with missing values filled (e.g., with NaN) for non-matching entries.

## Understanding with Examples:

#### Inner join

Imagine you have two DataFrames:

```python
import pandas as pd

customers = pd.DataFrame({'CustomerID': [1, 2, 3], 'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']})
orders = pd.DataFrame({'OrderID': [100, 101, 102], 'CustomerID': [1, 2, 4], 'Amount': [100, 200, 300]})
```

Here, `CustomerID` is the common column for joining. To create a new DataFrame with customer names and their corresponding order amounts, use an inner join:

```python
merged_df = customers.merge(orders, on='CustomerID')
print(merged_df)
```

Output:

```
  CustomerID Name  OrderID  Amount
0          1  Alice     100     100
1          2   Bob     101     200
```

This DataFrame includes only customers who have placed orders (inner join).

#### Left Join:

Now, let's say you want to include all customers, even if they haven't placed orders:

```python
merged_df = customers.merge(orders, on='CustomerID', how='left')
print(merged_df)
```

Output:

```
  CustomerID Name  OrderID  Amount
0          1  Alice     100     100
1          2   Bob     101     200
2          3  Charlie      NaN      NaN
```

The left join keeps all rows from `customers`, and for those without matching orders, `OrderID` and `Amount` are filled with NaN (Not a Number).

#### Multiple Join Keys and Handling Missing Values:

Suppose you have additional columns that might be helpful for joining:

```python
products = pd.DataFrame({'ProductID': [11, 12, 13], 'OrderID': [100, 101, 102], 'Description': ['Laptop', 'Phone', 'Tablet']})
```

To join `customers`, `orders`, and `products` on both `CustomerID` and `OrderID`, and specify how to handle missing values:

```python
merged_df = customers.merge(orders, on='CustomerID') \
                     .merge(products, how='left', on=['OrderID', 'CustomerID'], indicator=True)
print(merged_df)
```

Output:

```
  CustomerID Name  OrderID  Amount ProductID Description        _merge
0          1  Alice     100     100       11        Laptop  both
1          2   Bob     101     200       12        Phone  both
2          3  Charlie      NaN      NaN       NaN        None  left_only
```

- We chained two `merge()` calls for a multi-step join.
- `how='left'` ensures all rows from the combined customer-order DataFrame are included.
- `on=['OrderID', 'CustomerID']` specifies joining on both columns.
- `indicator=True` adds a column `_merge` that indicates the source of the row (both, left_only).



## Concatenation for Stacking DataFrames:

- **`concat()`:** Use this method to vertically stack (append one on top of another) DataFrames that share the same columns but don't necessarily have a common key for joining.

#### Example (Concatenating by Rows):

```python
region_sales = pd.DataFrame({'Region': ['East', 'West'], 'Sales': [10000, 15000]})
country_sales = pd.DataFrame({'Country': ['US', 'Canada'], 'Sales': [20000, 5000]})

# Concatenate along rows (axis=0)
combined_sales = pd.concat([region_sales, country_sales])
print(combined_sales)
```

Output:

```
   Region  Sales Country  Sales
0    East  10000       NaN    NaN
1    West  15000       NaN    NaN
0       NaN  20000      US  20000
1       NaN   5000  Canada   5000
```

#### Concatenating by Columns (Less Common):

You can also concatenate horizontally (side-by-side) using `concat()` (axis=1), but ensure both DataFrames have the same number of rows. This is less common than stacking rows.

Here's an example of concatenating DataFrames by columns (horizontally) in Pandas, though this usage is less common than stacking rows:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrames with the same number of rows (important for horizontal concatenation)
customer_data = pd.DataFrame({'CustomerID': [1, 2, 3], 'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']})
order_data = pd.DataFrame({'OrderID': [100, 101, 102], 'Amount': [100, 200, 300]})

# Concatenate horizontally (axis=1)
combined_df = pd.concat([customer_data, order_data], axis=1)
print(combined_df)
```

This code will output:

```
  CustomerID Name  OrderID  Amount
0          1  Alice     100     100
1          2   Bob     101     200
2          3  Charlie     102     300
```

**Key Points:**

- **Same Number of Rows:** For horizontal concatenation to work correctly, both DataFrames must have the same number of rows. In this example, both `customer_data` and `order_data` have 3 rows.
- **Shared Index (Optional):** While not strictly required, it's generally recommended for the DataFrames to have a shared index when concatenating horizontally. This helps maintain a clear association between rows in the combined DataFrame.
- **Less Common Usage:** Concatenating by columns is less frequently used compared to stacking rows (axis=0). It's often more practical to join DataFrames based on a common key for analysis.

##### Alternative Approach (Joining with Shared Index):

An alternative approach to achieve a similar result (combining customer and order information) might be to join the DataFrames on a common column like `CustomerID` (assuming it's unique):

```Python
combined_df = customer_data.set_index('CustomerID').join(order_data.set_index('CustomerID'))
print(combined_df)
```

This approach uses `set_index` to create a temporary index based on `CustomerID` for both DataFrames, then joins them. The resulting DataFrame will be similar to the horizontally concatenated one, but with a shared index for `CustomerID`.

Remember, choose the method that best suits your data structure and analysis goals.

### Choosing the Right Method:

- **`merge()`:** Use it for combining DataFrames based on a common column or index, with options for join types and handling missing values.
- **`.join()`:** Opt for it for simpler joins along a single column (often a left join).
- **`concat()`:** Choose it for stacking DataFrames vertically when they share the same columns but lack a common join key.

By effectively using these methods, you can seamlessly integrate data from various sources in Pandas, empowering you to conduct comprehensive data analysis.
