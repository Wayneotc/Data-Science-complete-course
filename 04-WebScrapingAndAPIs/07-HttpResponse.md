# HTTP Response

An HTTP response is what a server sends back to the client after receiving and processing an HTTP request. Like HTTP requests, HTTP responses have a structured format that includes three main components: the status line, headers, and an optional body. Let's delve into each part.

#### 1. Status Line
The status line is the first line of an HTTP response and contains three parts:
- **HTTP Version**
- **Status Code**
- **Reason Phrase**

**Example:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

- **HTTP Version:** This indicates the HTTP protocol version used by the server (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2`).
- **Status Code:** This is a three-digit code that indicates the result of the server's attempt to understand and satisfy the client's request. Status codes are categorized as follows:
  - `1xx` Informational: Request received, continuing process.
  - `2xx` Success: The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
  - `3xx` Redirection: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.
  - `4xx` Client Error: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
  - `5xx` Server Error: The server failed to fulfill a valid request.

- **Reason Phrase:** This is a short textual description of the status code.

**Example Status Codes:**
- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `404 Not Found`: The server cannot find the requested resource.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: The server encountered an unexpected condition.

#### 2. Headers
Headers in an HTTP response provide additional information about the response. They consist of key-value pairs and appear after the status line, each on a new line.

**Example:**
```http
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 138
Connection: keep-alive
```

**Common Headers:**
- **Content-Type:** Indicates the media type of the response body.
  ```http
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```

- **Content-Length:** The length of the response body in bytes.
  ```http
  Content-Length: 348
  ```

- **Connection:** Controls whether the network connection stays open after the current transaction.
  ```http
  Connection: close
  ```

- **Server:** Contains information about the server software handling the request.
  ```http
  Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)
  ```

- **Set-Cookie:** Used to send cookies from the server to the client.
  ```http
  Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly
  ```

- **Date:** The date and time at which the response was generated.
  ```http
  Date: Sat, 08 Jun 2024 12:35:00 GMT
  ```

- **Cache-Control:** Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.
  ```http
  Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
  ```

#### 3. Body
The body of an HTTP response is optional and contains the data requested by the client. The type and content of the body depend on the resource being requested and the headers provided.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

If the `Content-Type` header is `application/json`, the body might look like:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

### Example: Understanding an HTTP Response

Consider a practical example using Python's `requests` library to make a GET request and analyze the response components.

```python
import requests

# Define the URL
url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1'

# Make the GET request
response = requests.get(url)

# Print the status line
print(f"Status Line: {response.status_code} {response.reason}")

# Print the response headers
print("Response Headers:")
for k, v in response.headers.items():
    print(f"{k}: {v}")

# Print the response body
print("Response Body:")
print(response.text)
```

**Output:**
```
Status Line: 200 OK
Response Headers:
Date: Sat, 08 Jun 2024 12:35:00 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 292
Connection: keep-alive
Server: cloudflare
Vary: Origin, Accept-Encoding

Response Body:
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
  "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit repellat nisi...",
}
```

In this example:
- **Status Line:** The status line indicates a successful `200 OK` response.
- **Response Headers:** These include `Date`, `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Connection`, `Server`, and `Vary`.
- **Response Body:** Contains the JSON data for a specific post.

### Summary

An HTTP response is composed of three main parts:
- **Status Line:** Contains the HTTP version, status code, and reason phrase.
- **Headers:** Provide metadata about the response, such as content type, length, and caching policies.
- **Body:** Contains the actual data requested by the client, which can be HTML, JSON, XML, or other media types.

Understanding the anatomy of an HTTP response is crucial for web scraping and web development, as it helps in handling server responses effectively and ensuring robust communication between clients and servers.

### HTTP status codes

This table provides a comprehensive overview of HTTP status codes, their categories, descriptions, and practical examples. This knowledge is essential for understanding the various responses you might encounter while performing web scraping and how to handle them effectively.

| **Status Code**       | **Category**                    | **Description**                                              | **Example**                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1xx Informational** |                                 |                                                              |                                                              |
| 100                   | Continue                        | The initial part of a request has been received and the client should continue. | The client sends a request to the server with `Expect: 100-continue` header and receives 100 Continue in response before sending the body. |
| 101                   | Switching Protocols             | The server is switching protocols as requested by the client. | A client asks the server to switch protocols from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2.0 using the `Upgrade` header. |
| 102                   | Processing                      | The server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. | A WebDAV request that takes a long time to process returns 102 Processing to prevent the client from timing out. |
| 103                   | Early Hints                     | Used to return some response headers before final HTTP message. | A server sends headers early to hint about content type and other info before final response is ready. |
| **2xx Success**       |                                 |                                                              |                                                              |
| 200                   | OK                              | The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource. | A client requests a webpage and receives the full HTML content with status code 200 OK. |
| 201                   | Created                         | The request was successful, and a new resource was created.  | A client submits a form to create a new user account and receives 201 Created upon success. |
| 202                   | Accepted                        | The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete. | A client uploads a file, and the server returns 202 Accepted indicating the file will be processed later. |
| 203                   | Non-Authoritative Information   | The request was successful, but the returned information may be from another source. | A proxy server returns 203 Non-Authoritative Information indicating the data might not be from the original server. |
| 204                   | No Content                      | The request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response. | A client performs a DELETE operation on a resource and receives 204 No Content, indicating successful deletion without a body in the response. |
| 205                   | Reset Content                   | The request was successful, but the client should reset the view. | After a successful form submission, a client receives 205 Reset Content indicating the form should be cleared. |
| 206                   | Partial Content                 | The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client. | A client requests a portion of a video file using the Range header and receives 206 Partial Content with the requested bytes. |
| 207                   | Multi-Status                    | WebDAV; the message body contains multiple separate responses. | A WebDAV server returns 207 Multi-Status in response to a PROPFIND request, listing properties of multiple files. |
| 208                   | Already Reported                | WebDAV; members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply. | A WebDAV server indicates that the bindings have been enumerated in a previous response using 208 Already Reported. |
| 226                   | IM Used                         | The server has fulfilled a request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance. | A server returns 226 IM Used indicating that a delta encoding has been applied to the response body. |
| **3xx Redirection**   |                                 |                                                              |                                                              |
| 300                   | Multiple Choices                | The request has more than one possible response. The user or user agent can select a preferred response. | A client requests a resource that exists in multiple formats and receives 300 Multiple Choices with a list of available formats. |
| 301                   | Moved Permanently               | The requested resource has been moved to a new URL permanently. | A client requests a webpage that has been permanently moved to a new URL and receives 301 Moved Permanently with the new URL. |
| 302                   | Found                           | The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL. | A client requests a resource that is temporarily at a different URL and receives 302 Found with the temporary URL. |
| 303                   | See Other                       | The response to the request can be found under another URL using a GET method. | After submitting data, a client is redirected to another page with a 303 See Other status and the new URL. |
| 304                   | Not Modified                    | The resource has not been modified since the last request.   | A client revalidates a cached resource with a If-Modified-Since header and receives 304 Not Modified if it hasn't changed. |
| 305                   | Use Proxy                       | The requested resource is only available through a proxy.    | Deprecated due to security concerns; clients used to receive 305 Use Proxy indicating a proxy URL. |
| 306                   | Switch Proxy                    | No longer used, but reserved for future use.                 | Was used to indicate subsequent requests should use a specified proxy. |
| 307                   | Temporary Redirect              | The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL, but the client should use the original method for the request. | A client receives 307 Temporary Redirect indicating the resource is temporarily at a new URL and should use the same HTTP method. |
| 308                   | Permanent Redirect              | The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, and future requests should use the new URL. | Similar to 301, but the request method and body must not be changed; 308 Permanent Redirect indicates the new URL. |
| **4xx Client Error**  |                                 |                                                              |                                                              |
